export const TEST_CONSTANT = "Remove this when you add your own module files that you import from main.ts. This is an export, \
it wouldn't be here, but TypescriptToLua has a bug where if you only have a single file with no imports or exports, everything runs twice. \
Will be removed, along with this file, in a future update as soon as the TypescriptToLua team fixes it.";
